## contributing
whoever's bored enough to contribute is free to do so but there's a couple things i'd appreciate

### code style
try to keep lines at 79 characters or less (will probably change to 100 in the future) and follow PEP8 with names and other style conventions. keep imports ordered and clean, typehint all parameters (and return types if you make helper functions). overall, try to keep style consistent with the rest of the code.

### implementation
if i disagree with your way of doing something, i'll probably decline your PR and rewrite the same idea in my own words. just be smart and whatnot.
